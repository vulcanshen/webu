// minAppW is the narrowest terminal sshu draws in. The letter-tier strip

// still worth drawing at all.

// statusMinRoom is how much slack the tab row needs before it shows the status
// slot at all. Less than this and the text is all ellipsis, which reads as

// The tab row is ONE powerline strip, not three free-standing pills: a round cap
// opens it, the segments run together, slanted dividers separate them, a round
// cap closes it. The [Alt] lead and the active tab are lit — together they
// spell the chord.
//
// It was three separate capsules, and the unlit ones were filled with `crust` —
// a shade off the canvas — so they had no visible shape at all, while an
// unfocused PANEL chip (dark text on borderDim) was perfectly legible. The same
// app drew its two "not selected" states in opposite directions.
//
// Two things were tried before this. Raising the unlit fill to match the panel
// chip fixed visibility but made three filled pills in a row read as a strip of
// buttons — the thing the rule under this row exists to prevent. Outlining the
// unlit ones with thin half-circle caps (U+E0B7/E0B5) gave them a shape, but two
// thin arcs around dim text read as PARENTHESES rather than as a capsule.
//
// A chain answers both. It is one object, so the unlit segments are visibly part
// of something rather than floating; and it cannot be mistaken for a row of
// buttons, because a row of buttons has gaps and this has none. The earlier note
// here said sshu deliberately avoided filu's chain because "a chain says these
// are pages of one thing, and sshu's tabs are three co-existing surfaces" — but
// three co-existing surfaces of ONE app is exactly what the strip draws, and the
// separation that matters (chrome above, surface below) is the rule's job.
//
// The dividers are slashes — top right to bottom left — since 2026-09-21;
// sshu's filled triangles read as arrowheads on this row. The unlit segments are filled with the CANVAS colour: crust and
// surface0 were both tried as a visible trough behind them, and both were worse
// — surface0 too light to be recessed, crust a muddy band that added weight
// without adding information. With the arrows doing the structural work, the
// unlit segments do not need a fill of their own; what makes the strip legible
// is the lit one having a shape, not the others having a background.

// and one divider between neighbours.

// right, so its INK is the left fill and its background is the right one. Get
// that backwards and the transition still draws — same glyph, same width, same
